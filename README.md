# Bio of Leior Varon

A bio webpage crated as the final project of the CS563 WebDev course at PSU

## Sources

### Bootsrap

This webpage makes use of different features of bootstrap and relied heavily on the documentation and examples from the bootstrap documentation at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/

### Class HW and Lab Assignments

The navbar was mostly adapted from HW3 with some insights from HW4 and a lot of general searching around the web and other google searches.

The About section took my picture from the Cedarwood Waldorf School website (cedarwoodschool.org)

A lot of the styling and background began with a template from the code we reviewed as part of HW4.

Numerous logos were taken from random sites that appeared in google image searches.

### XKCD

A number of images of cartoons were taken from the very gracious xkcd.com

### W3schools.com

This tutorial website was useful for a bunch of parts, including instructions on how to add emojis as part of text.

### LinkedIn

I took a lot of my work and education information from my LinkedIn page, as well as to recreate some of the general styling of the liat of jobs/schools on the website.

## Deployment + Repo

This page is set up as a public github repository: https://github.com/nobody27/bio.

This website is deployed by github pages: https://nobody27.github.io/bio

All in all, the deployment went smoothly. Nothing special is required to

## Additional features

I spent way too much time working on additional features and, in the end, I ran out of time before implementing a lot of what I wanted: including fetching data from APIs and adding some bootstrap effects, such as rotating the pictures.

### HTML Mailto

I was able to get the form to open the default mail app and set my email address, a subject I chose, and information from the form, however I only provided basic javascript functionality of printing the data in the console, and currently, the email message isn't formatted the best.

### Bootstrap accordion

The accordion was relatively simple to use. I had hoped to use the XKCD API to display a random cartoon each time the user opens the accordion, however I got bogged down by CORS errors, and different web tutorials didn't end up helping, so I just used embedded images.
